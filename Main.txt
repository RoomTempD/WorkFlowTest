This resolved the conflict.

This line is no longer a conflict.
some line

I don't like the COLOR BLACK anymore. It is very depressing. 

I see the sunrise creeping in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she’s gone again

I’m just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart’s behind the pocket of my shirt
I’ll just keep rolling till I’m in the dirt
‘Cause I’m a traveller, oh, I’m a traveller
I couldn’t tell you honey, I don’t know
Where I’m going but I’ve got to go
‘Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I’m a traveller, oh, I’m a traveller
